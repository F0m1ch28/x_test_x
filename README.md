My site runs on Express, this is such a convenient thing for Node.js that helps build a web server. I have a form on index.html, and when someone fills it out and clicks the "Create Job" button, the data is sent to my server.

On the server I wrote a code that checks whether all the necessary data has arrived. If something is missing, he immediately talks about it. And if everything is in place, the server communicates with Pipedrive through their API - such a special system for automatic data exchange between programs. That is, in fact, I automated the creation of transactions in Pipedrive directly from my website, without any manual data entry.

After this, the server reports back to the page: whether the deal was created successfully or not. And all this happens in just a few clicks!

Now about the iframe - this is an element on web pages that allows you to embed one page into another. I created a separate page iframe-container.html where I placed an iframe with index.html inside. This is useful if you want to show your form on another site or inside a management system without leaving it.
